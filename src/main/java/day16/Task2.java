/*Implement a program that writes numbers of different types to 2 files. File 1 should be called “file1.txt” and File 2
should be called “file2.txt”. Both files must be in the root of the project. Files should not be created manually, but
when the program is started. File 1 must contain 1000 random numbers from 0 to 100. File 2 is based on File 1 but
contains numbers of the real data type.

The method for filling File 2 is as follows: for each group of 20 integers from File 1, their arithmetic mean is
calculated. Then, the resulting value is written to File 2. Thus, File 2 will contain 50 real numbers (1000/20 = 50).

After File 2 has been generated, the static method printResult(File file) must be implemented. This method should
calculate the sum of all real numbers from File 2 and print it to the console, discarding the real part.*/
