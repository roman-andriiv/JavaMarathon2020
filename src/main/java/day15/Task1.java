    Given a file with information about the remaining shoes in the warehouse (src/main/resources/shoes.csv) . This is
an example of a real unloading of residues from 1C to a ".csv" file (file format with separators, the symbol “;” is
used as a separator). This file contains information about the name of the shoe model, its size and the quantity
remaining in stock.
    Before converting to csv it was a table with three columns.
It is necessary to generate a new file (src/main/resources/missing_shoes.txt) with information about models and sizes
of shoes that are not in stock (quantity = 0) . To do this, implement a program that takes a ".csv" file as input and
creates a new ".txt" file.
