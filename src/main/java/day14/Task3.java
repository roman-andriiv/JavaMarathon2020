Create a class “Person” with fields “name” and “age”. Implement a static List<Person> parseFileToObjList() method that
reads the contents of the same "people.txt" file, creates instances of the Person class, and returns a list of objects.
Get this list in the main() method and print it to the console.

If the file does not exist in the project folder, the program must throw an exception and output the message
“File not found” to the console. In addition, if the age value is negative, it is necessary to throw an exception and
print the message “Invalid input file” to the console.*/
