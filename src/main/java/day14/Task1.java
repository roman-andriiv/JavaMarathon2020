Create a ".txt" file in the project folder.
Fill it in manually with ten arbitrary numbers. Implement a static method printSumDigits(File file) that calculates the
sum of all numbers.txt in this file and prints it to the screen. Call this method in the main() method.
If the file does not exist in the project folder, the program must throw an exception and output the message “File not
found” to the console. In addition, if the numbers.txt in the file are less than or greater than 10, it is necessary to
throw an exception and display the message “Incorrect input file” in the console.
